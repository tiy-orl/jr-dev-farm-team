							# When
              ---
              * Your team spends hours/week on grunt work
              * Growing list of low-priority todos
              * Codebase is junior-friendly
              ---
              ## Junior-Friendly Code 
              * Readable
              * Modular
              * Tested
              * Extensible
              * Clear
              * Simple

              ## Quality Code 
              * Readable
              * Modular
              * Tested
              * Extensible
              * Clear
              * Simple
              * _Efficient_
              * _Reliable_
							---
              * Your team spends hours/week on grunt work
              * Growing list of low-priority todos
              * Codebase is junior-friendly
              * _You'll need a mid in n months_
              ---
							## Jr vs Mid vs Sr
							---
							# Sr Devs

							* Can Solve Problems
							* Can make technical decisions
							* Knows when something is good enough
							* Knows when something is overkill
							* Knows what they know, and what they don't

							---
							# Mid Dev

							* Can Solve Problems
							* Is usually told the tech stack to use
							* Knows when something is good enough
							* Needs to be told when something is overkill
							* Knows what they know, but not what they don't

							---
							# Jr Dev

							* Can Solve Problems
							* Needs to be told what tech and libraries to use
							* Needs to be told when something is good enough
							* Needs to be told when something is overkill
							* Insecure about what they know
              ---
              # Objections
              ---
              # _The work we do is too hard_
              ---
              ## Probably! (In part)
              * There's lots of complex software being written
              * ...usually accompanied by lots of CRUD
              ---
              ### Senior-Level Work !== All Work
              * How many hours do sr spend on jr tasks?
              * Is freeing ^those hours worth cost of jr?
              ---
              ## _We don't have time/team is too small to babysit_
              ---
              ## Possibly!
              * Onboarding jr is time- and labor-intensive
              * Expect to spend 3-6hr/wk for mo+
              ---

              ## Syllogism (II)
              * I want to hire someone capable
              * I am capable
              * I _learned_ X

              ---
              ## _How Do You Find That??_
              ---
							* You're probably not paying devs to write algorithms.
              * You're paying them to write/maintain software.
              * Anyone worth interviewing has written _some_ software.
              ---
              ### Converse About Their Code
              * What do they like about it?
              * What would they do different next time?
              * What could they optimize?
              * Give candidate piece of code, ask them to review it
              ---
							Talk to them about their previous experiences; most jr devs had a career before software. ** This is an asset! **
							---
              <blockquote style="margin: 0;width:100%">[H]ave the candidate give a 10 min watercooler presentation to your team on something they've worked on....You'll quickly ascertain:

                  <li>Can they <strong>communicate effectively</strong> to a small group?</li>

              ### Value What They Know Over What They Don't
              * Avoid false negatives in interviewing
              * Anything worth knowing can be learned
              * Advertise the must-haves

              * a _slower_ version of a senior
              * a _stupider_ version of a senior
              ---
              ## A Junior _Is_:
              * a _less knowledgeable_ version of a senior

              * a _less confident_ version of a senior

              ## Tips from What We've Seen at TIY
              ---
              * Hire for aptitude, trajectory, and culture, not for technical skill level or prior experience. If that is what you want, you're not hiring a junior developer.
              ---
              * Provide guidance, reassurance, and camraderie.
              ---
              * Know limits of juniors' abilities - and push them whenever possible.
              ---
              * Encourage (i.e. require) pairing with juniors a few times a week. Especially on unfamiliar parts of the system.
